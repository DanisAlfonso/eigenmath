Example 2. Compute $212^{17}$ and save as $N$,
then show the value of $N$.

{\color{blue}
\begin{verbatim}
N = 212^17
N
\end{verbatim}}

$N=3529471145760275132301897342055866171392$

Note: The above examples were inspired by the following passage from
Vladimir Nabokov's autobiography ``Speak, Memory.''

\begin{quote}
A foolish tutor had explained logarithms to me much too early, and I had
read (in a British publication, the {\it Boy's Own Paper}, I believe)
about a certain Hindu calculator who in exactly two seconds could find the
seventeenth root of, say,
3529471145760275132301897342055866171392
(I am not sure I have got this right; anyway the root was 212).
